Consept of a better rocket for the future from my brains!

   
  ____ represents the capsual, the capsual at this point in time, should be able to be bigger, sending to planet X or whatever.
   /\  More sustanable life, fuel, etc
  //\\
 ///\\\
|//  \\| X Time before fire = 1/2 burn of inner shell. || what the best math ratio is.
|/    \| X Time before fire = 1/2 burn of inner shell.
|      | X Time before fire = 1/2 burn of inner shell.

Each pipe | repersents Lite Fuel.
Each rocket is basiclly hollowed out and stacked togather.
The core holds the most solid peice of the rocket, which then concure's a 5000+ mile || X up, before it runs out of fuel.
When it runs out it falls out the center, now the rocket is sablized by the first shell which fires inbetween 1/2 3/4 empty of the cores.
Now at this point the first should inbetween 1/4 1/2 full, which causes the 2nd shell to then fire, and so on.

What this brings about is a more stable flight, and it allows a simple reusable product.

What should happen is it flys faster, have stablility, will lighter via every shell that drops. should cost less fuel consumstion.

It allows us to combine everything in earth, & be able to roboticly go father distances in space, will mother ship so to speak.
